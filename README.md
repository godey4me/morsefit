morsefit
========

This code tries to fit the parameters for Morse potentials to potential energy
surfaces from higher levels of theory. It uses it own format for inputing
structures and energies, so it could possibly be used with different ab-initio
quantum chemistry codes. The documentation can be found
[here](http://tschijnmo.github.io/morsefit/doc/index.html).
